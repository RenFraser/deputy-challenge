# Assumptions:
- There are potentially more than 1 roots to the trees
- Each role/employee ID is unique.
- IDs can be any integer, including negatives and zero

# Design decisions:
- I've traded space for faster runtimes because it's cheaper to buy more disks than CPUs
- Because there are potentially multiple roots to a tree
